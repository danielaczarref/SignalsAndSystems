# Some Useful Signal Models

## Step Function

A Step Function (aka staircase function) is defined as a piecewise constant function that has only a finite number of pieces. In other words, a function on the real numbers can be described as a finite linear combination of indicator functions of given intervals. It is a discontinuous function and it's defined by f: R -> R if y = f(x) = [x] for x in R

## Impulse Function

It's one of the more useful functions in the study of linear systems An ideal impulse function is a function that is zero everywhere but at the origin, where it's infinitely high. However, the area of the impulse is infinite.
